    "bio": "Music has always been a passion of mine. When I was younger, I learned about the music genre EDM and it changed my view on music. I mostly favour the house genre of EDM but I enjoy all others. This passion is what inspired the idea of this website. While EDM is my favorite genre, I like branching out to other types also. Having a website that can show the current top songs makes it easier for me to stay in the loop for all genres.",
